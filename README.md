# DinoDungeon

DinoDungeon is an exciting top down game built with the game engine we're creating from scratch in CIS380. 

You play as an ancient dinosaur using modern weaponry to mow down all of the enemies in your way. Why? Because you can!

Collect items, upgrade your weapons, survive waves of enemies, and get as far into the dungeon as you can!
